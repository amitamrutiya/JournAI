    text: "I'm absolutely furious right now. Spent 2 hours stuck in traffic because of some construction they decided to start during rush hour. No warning signs, no alternate routes posted. Just pure incompetence from the city planning department. Made me 40 minutes late to my client meeting, which was completely embarrassing. These are the same people who complain about road conditions but can't manage basic traffic flow. And then my boss had the nerve to question my time management. This whole day has been a disaster.",

Dr. Google isn't helping my anxiety - every search leads to worst-case scenarios. I made an appointment with my doctor, but it's not until next Thursday. The waiting is the hardest part.

It wasn't a fight or anything dramatic - just the slow realization that we're different people now than we were in college.

    mood: Moods.FRUSTRATED,
    title: "Bureaucratic Nightmare",
    text: "Spent the entire day trying to get my passport renewed, and it's like they designed the system to be as difficult as possible. First office sent me to the second office, who sent me back to the first office because I was missing Form X, which no one mentioned I needed. Then discovered the notary closes at 3 PM on Wednesdays.

    text: "Got a $75 parking ticket even though I was parked legally! The meter was broken - it wouldn't take coins, cards, or even the app payment. I left a note on my windshield explaining the situation, but apparently that means nothing to the parking enforcement. Spent an hour on the phone with the city trying to contest it, only to be told I need to appear in court during business hours. This is highway robbery disguised as municipal service!",
    summary:
      "Furious about receiving unjust parking ticket due to broken meter",
